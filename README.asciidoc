sigtrap is a simple utility that can execute an arbitrary Unix command when a
particular POSIX IPC signal is received. After registering the signal handler,
the process sleeps until awakened by the signal.

Compile sigtrap using gcc with:

----
gcc -o sigtrap sigtrap.c -liberty
----

Usage: 

----
sigtrap <signal> <command> [arguments...]
----

sigtrap can react to the following signals:

* +USR1+
* +USR2+
* +HUP+
* +INT+
* +ILL+
* +BUS+
* +FPE+
* +URG+
* +PWR+
* +SYS+

Using +SIGUSR1+ or +SIGUSR2+ is recommended, as these signals have no pre-defined
standard meaning that must be overridden.
